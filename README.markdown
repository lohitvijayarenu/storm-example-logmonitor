# Example Logmonitor using Storm

Work in progress to get some Spouts and Bolts to process log files
This example generate random log line with emits IP and code for state. 
Blot aggregrate count by state and summarizes based on state. 

I believe we could achieve it with only 1 bolt, but need to re-visit.
